Easy Archive File Extension Converter
This project is a tool for easily converting archive file extensions, supporting archive files of up to 50MB. It allows users to change file formats such as .zip, .7z, .tar, and more with ease.

Please note:

Files with passwords will not be fully converted. Instead, only an empty archive will be produced.
The converter is designed for small to medium-sized archive files, with a focus on simplicity and convenience.
This project can be a handy utility for anyone who needs quick and simple archive conversions without diving into complex tools.

Feel free to contribute or report any issues to help improve this tool!
