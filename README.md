# Free Archive File Extension Converter


## üó£Ô∏è About this project
Easy Archive File Extension Converter This project is a tool for easily converting archive file extensions, supporting archive files of up to 50MB. It allows users to change file formats such as .zip, .7z, .tar, and more with ease.

This project is a personal project, so development progress may be slow.

## üìì Please note:
 Files with passwords will not be fully converted. Instead, only an empty archive will be produced. 
 The converter is designed for small to medium-sized archive files, with a focus on simplicity and convenience. 

 This project can be a handy utility for anyone who needs quick and simple archive conversions without diving into complex tools.

 Feel free to contribute or report any issues to help improve this tool!

   - Download link provision

# üöÄ Performance Optimization with BullMQ

## üìå Challenge
When handling multiple file conversions, significant performance issues arose as processing times increased proportionally with the number of files. This bottleneck became a critical challenge in ensuring scalability and efficiency.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution
To overcome this, **BullMQ** was introduced to manage **asynchronous task queues**. Key improvements achieved:
- **Parallelized task execution** to reduce processing times.
- **Optimized resource utilization** for enhanced scalability.
- Seamless integration with existing workflows to improve overall system performance.

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Metric                  | Before BullMQ       | After BullMQ        | Improvement |
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Processing Time**     | 3:27.262 (m:ss.mmm) | 1:25.686 (m:ss.mmm) | ~60% Faster |

### **Detailed Results**

- **Before BullMQ**  
   `7z compression completed in 3:27.262 (m:ss.mmm)`
